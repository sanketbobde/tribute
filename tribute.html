           Life History of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha kingdom of India. The kingdom's security was entirely based on religious tolerance and 
the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus.

 

Shivaji Maharaj who was the descendant of a line of prominent nobles was very brave and fought many wars to consolidate India.
 At that time, India was under the Muslim rulers and divided. The Mughals were in north India and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur as well as of Golconda in the south of India. 
The ancestral estates of Shivaji Maharaj were situated in the Deccan region in the realm of Bijapur sultans. He found the suppression of the Muslim rulers and the 
persecution of all the Hindus in the region. He was sad due to the devastating condition of the Hindus that by the age of 16 he convinced himself to be the cause of the 
Hindu’s freedom. It was a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his whole life.
Childhood and Early Life of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
He grew up studying Ramayana and also Mahabharata. He showed intense interest in the religious teachings, especially of the Hindu and Sufi Saints. 
He was brought up by his mother Jijabai and also by his administrator Dadoji Kond Deo. Dadoji taught him horse riding, archery, patta, and also several other
 fighting techniques after his father left for Karnataka with his second wife Tukabai.
Conquests of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
With this motive, Shivaji Maharaj began to seize the weaker Bijapur outposts and his followers. In this process, he ruined a few of his very influential coreligionists. 
They had aligned themselves with the sultans. His daring military skills and sternness towards the Hindus' oppression had him win many battles and administrations.
 His depredations grew very audacious, and various minor expeditions sent to chastise him always proved to be ineffective.
In 1659, when the Sultan of Bijapur sent an army of around 20 thousand soldiers under the leadership of Afzal Khan to defeat him, Shivaji Maharaj intelligently defeated Afzal Khan.
 He pretended to be intimidated and enticed the force deep into the difficult mountain terrains and then killed Afzal Khan at a meeting to which he had lured him by all 
submissive appeals. 

For the time being, the handpicked troops that had been previously positioned swooped down on the unwary Bijapur army and routed it.
 Overnight, Shivaji Maharaj became a daunting warlord with the possession of horses, guns, as well as ammunition of the Bijapur army.
Alarmed by the rising strength of Shivaji Maharaj, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ordered his viceroy of the south to march against him. He encountered himself by carrying
 out a very daring and brave raid right within the encampment of the viceroy. In this raid, he lost his one hand and his son's fingers. 
Embarrassed by this reverse, the viceroy withdrew his force. After this incident, Shivaji was thought to provoke the Mughals. He attacked the rich coastal town of Surat and 
took immense booty.  Aurangzeb, disappointed and raged by this incident, could hardly ignore the loss, and to avenge Shivaji Maharaj, he sent out his most prominent 
general, Mirza Raja Jai Singh. Mirza Raja was sent along with 100 thousand men. 

 The pressure that was exerted by this vast force which was also combined with the drive and tenacity of Jai Singh, very soon compelled Shivaji Maharaj to call for peace.
 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj undertook that he and his son would attend the court of Aurangzeb at Agra to be formally accepted as Mughal vassals. In Agra, hundreds and 
thousands of miles from their homeland, Shivaji Maharaj and his son were both placed under house arrest. During the house arrest, they lived under the threat of execution.
Fearlessly, Shivaji Maharaj feigned illness, and therefore as atonement, he began to send out enormous baskets filled with delicious sweets that were to be distributed among 
the poor. In the year 1666 of 17 August, he and his son had themselves carried past their guards in these baskets. His escape was the most thrilling and daring episode filled
 with very high drama, which was about to change the course of Indian history. 
His devoted followers welcomed him back as their great leader, and in the coming two years after this escape, he achieved many wars. He not only conquered and won back the 
lost territories but also expanded his domain. He collected tribute from the Mughal regions and also raided their rich cities. He also reorganized the army and instituted reforms 
for his subjects' welfare. 
Tak connived at forcible conversions, and also demolished temples, and erected mosques in their places.
